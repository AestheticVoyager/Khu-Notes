#  Computing the Overlay of Two Subdivisions

### 1. Classes:

#### `Vertex`:
- Represents a point in a 2D plane, defined by x and y coordinates.
- Optional index attribute allows for unique identification of each vertex.

#### `HalfEdge`:
- Represents a directed edge in a planar subdivision.
- Contains pointers to its origin, twin edge, next edge in sequence, previous edge, and the face it belongs to.
- Optional index attribute facilitates identification.

#### `Face`:
- Represents a face in a planar subdivision.
- Comprises an outer boundary, defined by a half-edge, and inner boundaries.
- Optional index and name attributes are used for identification.

#### `FaceRecord`:
- A data structure used during the overlay algorithm to keep track of faces and their components.
- Stores the outer boundary and inner components of a face.

#### `DoublyConnectedEdgeList`:
- Represents a planar subdivision using a doubly-connected edge list (DCEL).
- Maintains lists of vertices, half-edges, and faces.

### 2. Overlay Algorithm:

#### Step 1: Initialization
- Initialize the classes and data structures for vertices, half-edges, and faces.

#### Step 2: Intersection Calculation
- Compute intersections between edges of two planar subdivisions (`S1` and `S2`) using a plane sweep algorithm.
- Update the overlay (`D`) based on the intersection points.
- During this process, edges of both `S1` and `S2` are considered, and `D` is built incrementally.

#### Step 3: Connectivity Setup
- Prepare `D` for further processing by establishing connectivity between edges and vertices.
- This step ensures that the data in `D` is organized properly for subsequent analysis.

#### Step 4: Boundary Cycle Determination
- Traverse edges of `D` to determine the boundary cycles.
- This step identifies the loops that form the outer boundaries and inner holes within the overlay.

#### Step 5: Graph Construction
- Construct a graph (`G`) where nodes represent boundary cycles, and arcs connect each hole cycle to the cycle on its left.
- Identify connected components in `G`. Connected components represent separate regions within the overlay.

#### Step 6: Face Record Creation
- For each connected component in `G`, create a face record for the outer boundary.
- Construct a list of inner components representing holes within the face.

#### Step 7: Face Labeling
- Label each face of the overlay `D` with the names of the faces from `S1` and `S2` that contain it.
- This ensures that the resulting overlay maintains information about its origin in the original planar subdivisions.

### 3. Explanation:

The overlay algorithm systematically processes two planar subdivisions (`S1` and `S2`) to create their overlay (`D`). It involves intricate steps, including intersection calculation, boundary determination, graph construction, and face labeling. The algorithm maintains the integrity of the original data structures while creating a new representation that encapsulates the shared geometry of the input subdivisions. The resulting overlay can be further analyzed or visualized, and each face is labeled with information about its origin in the original subdivisions. This comprehensive approach ensures a robust solution for overlaying planar subdivisions.
