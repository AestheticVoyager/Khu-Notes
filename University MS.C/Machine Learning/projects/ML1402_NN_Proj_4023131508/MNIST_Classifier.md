# MNIST Neural Network Classifier

This Python script uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).

# Overview
The script will fetch the MNIST dataset, normalize pixel values, split the data into training and testing sets, and train an MLP classifier. The training progress will be displayed, and the final accuracy on the test set will be printed.
The MNIST dataset is fetched using scikit-learn's fetch_openml function.
