# Introduction to Knapsack Problem, its Types and How to solve them

The **Knapsack problem** is an example of the combinational optimization problem. This problem is also commonly known as the “**Rucksack Problem**“. 
The name of the problem is defined from the maximization problem as mentioned below:
`Given a bag with maximum weight capacity of W and a set of items, each having a weight and a value associated with it. Decide the number of each item to take in a collection such that the total weight is less than the capacity and the total value is maximized.`

## Types of Knapsack Problem:

The knapsack problem can be classified into the following types:
1. Fractional Knapsack Problem
2. 0/1 Knapsack Problem
3. Bounded Knapsack Problem
4. Unbounded Knapsack Problem


## 1. [Fractional Knapsack Problem]()

The Fractional Knapsack problem can be defined as follows:

> Given the weights and values of **N** items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity **W** to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of the knapsack.
